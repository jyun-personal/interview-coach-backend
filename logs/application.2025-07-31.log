While the response displays a proactive attitude toward resolving the problem quickly, it lacks clarity and depth regarding how you would actually approach fixing the discrepancies. The idea of "figuring out workarounds" suggests a temporary fix rather than addressing the root cause, which could compromise data integrity and overall project quality. Additionally, the response doesn't mention communicating with stakeholders, prioritizing tasks, or balancing the resolution with project deadlines—all important aspects of such a situation. To strengthen your answer, consider elaborating on a structured approach to diagnosing the issue, implementing corrective measures, and ensuring minimal disruption to the project timeline.
