Reference types, such as String, arrays, and custom objects, store references to objects in memory. The key difference is how they store data and how memory is allocated for them. Primitive types are stored on the stack, while reference types are stored on the heap with a reference on the stack., aiFeedbackText=This is a solid foundational answer that clearly distinguishes between primitive and reference types. You've correctly identified several primitive types and highlighted their storage location. To enhance this, consider adding an example of each type's declaration and usage. Also, briefly touch upon wrapper classes and their role in bridging the gap between primitive and reference types, which demonstrates a more complete understanding. Overall, a good start, showing strong theoretical knowledge.

Your response briefly mentions some of the variable types in Java, which is good, but it could be improved in several ways. It would be clearer to list both primitive types and reference types separately, giving more specific explanations of each, including their purpose and some key differences (such as size, mutability, and the fact that String is an object, not a primitive). Additionally, mentioning the difference between primitive types and objects would help deepen the understanding. The communication style is straightforward but somewhat brief; expanding a little for clarity and context would benefit someone trying to learn the topic. Overall, it covers the basics but could be more informative and precise.

However, the answer could be more comprehensive. For example, addressing whether you would assess the bug's impact or prioritize potential fixes before end-of-day could strengthen your approach. Clarifying if you would follow up with a post-incident review or suggest ways to mitigate risk until the issue is resolved would also improve the completeness.

Your response touches on a key aspect of frontend-backend integration by mentioning useEffect and fetch, which are central tools in React for data retrieval. However, it’s quite brief and lacks detail about the overall architecture, how the data flows, or specific challenges you encountered and solved. It also doesn't provide insight into the complexity of the feature, any state management strategies, or how you ensured smooth communication between frontend and backend. To improve, aim to describe the feature more comprehensively—perhaps outline the steps, highlight your decision-making process, and mention how you handled potential issues like asynchronous data loading or error handling.
